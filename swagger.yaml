      summary: Health Check
      description: "A health-check or simply health endpoint can be very useful for testing and inspecting a running API, especially when rather implementation-specific information is used. It can also be used as the endpoint called by automated monitoring and alerting. For a microservice, the health often depends on several dependencies. The health endpoint can list the status of the dependencies.<br/>
      The healthcheck endpoint provides detailed information about the health of a web service. If each of the components required by the service are healthy, then the service is considered healthy and will return a 200 OK response. If any of the components needed by the service are unhealthy, then a 503 Service Unavailable response will be provided."
